# Loan_Repayment_Predictions_with_TensorFlow_and_Keras
An 89% accurate Sequential model is fit to the data with the aim to make predictions on whether a new customers are likely or not to repay his loan. Data Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Mining yield interesting and informative insights into the accounts that have been charged off versus fully paid accounts.  In this project I use the following libraries and toolkits: Scikit-learn, Natural Language Toolkit, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas.  loan_status is the variable that we want to predict.  The Data We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club
